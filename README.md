# Calc_Demo.py

A Python project that generates random mathematical exercises, evaluates them, and writes the results to result.txt.

## Project Overview 
This program creates a set of random mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and outputs the results to a file. The number of exercises is specified by the user.


##  File Structure 
  Calc_Demo.py       # Main program that generates and evaluates expressions
  result.txt      # The file generated after running the program


##  How It Works 
The program asks the user to input a number n (the number of exercises to generate).
It randomly generates n mathematical expressions (with 3-5 numbers and operations).
It evaluates each expression and writes the results to result.txt in the same directory.
